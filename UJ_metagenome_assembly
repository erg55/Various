#this uses clumpify to deduplicate, Trimmomatic to trim and bbmerge to merge reads. These are all different tools than Piotr has used but they are installed and here is how to access them. This example uses the Tettigarcta crinita metagenome and attempts to assemble the Sulcia genome.

#Deduplication
#For this we can use a tool in bbmap called clumpify. Deduplication makes assembly faster by getting rid of optical or pcr duplicates which don't contribute to coverage.

#Trimming
#For this we use Trimmomatic. We will also need to download a file with the sequence of the Illumina adaptor we think was used into our working directory. This command tells trimmomatic to remove any sequences matching Illumina adaptors, remove low quality (< 3 quality score) trailing or leading bases, using a sliding window of 4 bases removing windows where the quality score is less than 20 on average and finally discarding any read less than 50 bp long after all trimming.

#Merging
#Next is merging the paired reads. This can only occur if the insert size was short enough that the two 150 bp reads on either side overlapped. I have been told merging about half is a good percentage.
